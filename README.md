## Specs
+ Raspberry Pi Model A+ (Running the bare-metal code library written over the course of CS107e, in addition to project code)
+ Power Supply: MB-V2 Breadboard Power Supply with 9v power adapter 
+ Display: Dell E228WPFC Black LCD Monitor with an acrylic, 2-way mirror mounted in front
+ Motion Sensor: HC-SR501 PIR Motion Sensor
+ Wifi: ESP-WROOM-32
+ Temperature & Humidity: DHT-11
+ Navigation Dial: KY-040 Rotary Encoder

## Hardware Setup
### Display
The monitor must be plugged into an outlet and connected to the Pi with an HDMI cable. The acrylic 2-way mirror was cut to size by scoring the mirror then snapping off the excess. It was mounted to the monitor using velcro strips.

### Power Supply 
The MB-V2 power supply is mounted on a breadboard. With the power supply at the "top", the 3.3V rail is on the right, and the 5v rail is on the left. The jumpers on the power supply determine what voltage goes to the rails.
The Pi is powered using the 5v and ground pins in the middle of the power supply while all other components are powered using the rails. 

### Motion Sensor
The HC-SR501 motion sensor has 3 pins. It is powered with 5v and is connected to `GPIO_PIN19`. The jumper is set to react to multiple triggers, meaning the amount of time the sensor is high after being triggered is reset every time the sensor picks up motion. 

### Temperature/Humidity
The DHT-11 has 3 pins. It is powered with 3.3v and is connected to `GPIO_PIN26`. 

### Rotary Dial
The KY-040 Rotary Encoder has 5 pins. It is powered using 3.3 V. 
The CLK pin is connected to `GPIO_PIN16`
The DT pin is connected to `GPIO_PIN20`
The SW pin is connected to `GPIO_PIN21`

### ESP-WROOM-32
The ESP-32 is used to connect the Raspberry Pi to the internet in order to fetch current date, time, weather, and headlines. 
It is powered using the 3.3v rail on the breadboard. It is connected to the Pi's TX/RX pins via its own TX/RX pins, and communicates using UART. The ESP-32 was programmed using Arduino IDE based on code provided by Chris Gregg. When uploading to the ESP-32, make sure the 3.3v wire is disconnected and the Pi is off. When the Arduino IDE says it is "Connecting...", press and hold the button labeled "DOI" until upload begins. 

## Code
### [`smart_display.c`](https://github.com/cs107e/juliagong-danielkang92-evandeo-project/blob/master/smart_display.c)
Contains `main()`, which initializes the modules, profiles, and sensors. It then calls `display()`, which is the main loop that draws the page if motion is detected. It also allows user to click into settings page. 

### [`module_display.c`](https://github.com/cs107e/juliagong-danielkang92-evandeo-project/blob/master/module_display.c)
Takes current page configuration and displayis all the modules within the page. We check if we need to update information for each module (e.g. new time), and fetch the data if so. We then display each module's content.

### [`module.c`](https://github.com/cs107e/juliagong-danielkang92-evandeo-project/blob/master/module.c)
A module encapsulates and represents a stand-alone entity with one defined function. We have 5 defined modules: Proximity, Temperature, DateTime, Weather, and Headline.
Each module should have the following characteristics:
- It should be able to report if we have new information: this is most relevant for the proximity sensor.
- It should have a defined function to update its content: in most of our cases, we call corresponding function in sensors, which then populates our content with formatted, newest information.
- It should have contents, which are sets of string buffers. Each buffer is then displayed using our `module_display.c`. 

### [`sensors.c`](https://github.com/cs107e/juliagong-danielkang92-evandeo-project/blob/master/sensors.c)
Contains the code for communicating directly with the various sensors. It initializes and reads in data from the sensors. 
`sensors.c` also implements interrupts for the rotary dial. Data is initially stored in an array of strings, which is formatted into a `resultBuf` for printing to the display. 

### [`output_formatter.c`](https://github.com/cs107e/juliagong-danielkang92-evandeo-project/blob/master/output_formatter.c)
Formats the data array of strings from `sensors.c` into `buf` arrays that can be printed to the display. 

### [`profile.c`](https://github.com/cs107e/juliagong-danielkang92-evandeo-project/blob/master/profile.c)
Each *profile* represents a set of settings, which include the following:
- Configuration for each module
- Configuration for each page: information about which module to display at which location
- Font/theme settings

The code is written so that we can have multiple user profiles to switch back and forth between, though we do not yet support it in the user interface.

### [`settings.c`](https://github.com/cs107e/juliagong-danielkang92-evandeo-project/blob/master/settings.c)
Implements the settings menu, which allows the user to customize the display format of the Date, Time, Temperature, and Humidity modules. The user can also choose between 5 theme colors and 2 fonts. 

### [`font.c`](https://github.com/cs107e/juliagong-danielkang92-evandeo-project/blob/master/font.c)
Contains the definition for our two different fonts and allows for switching between them.

### [`custom_font_draw.c`](https://github.com/cs107e/juliagong-danielkang92-evandeo-project/blob/master/custom_font_draw.c)
Supports drawing strings of different integer scales with supported fonts.

### [`font_gen`](https://github.com/cs107e/juliagong-danielkang92-evandeo-project/tree/master/font_gen)
Contains the two python scripts used for generation of `.bmp` image for fonts and generation of the necessary C data structure from the `.bmp` image (see *References* for source attribution).
+ [`generate_font_bitmap.py`](https://github.com/cs107e/juliagong-danielkang92-evandeo-project/blob/master/font_gen/generate_font_bitmap.py): Modified from open-source [Bitmap Font Generation Script](http://github.com/sole/snippets/blob/master/gimp/generate_bitmap_font/sole_generate_bitmap_font.py) for Gimp software. Allows for generation of a `.bmp` image with monospaced characters for font creation that is then parsed by `convert_bmp.py`.
+ [`convert_bmp.py`](https://github.com/cs107e/juliagong-danielkang92-evandeo-project/blob/master/font_gen/convert_bmp.py): Modified from code provided by Chris Gregg. Allows for generation of a C data structure from a provided `.bmp` image that is compatible with the `gl.c` module.

### [`website`](https://github.com/cs107e/juliagong-danielkang92-evandeo-project/tree/master/website)
Three python scripts are hosted at Evander's Stanford directory.
+ [`gettime.py`](http://web.stanford.edu/~evandeo/cgi-bin/gettime.py): Utilizes python's datetime object to print out the current date and time
+ [`getweather.py`](http://web.stanford.edu/~evandeo/cgi-bin/getweather.py): Utilizes OpenWeatherMap to print current weather conditions in Palo Alto. Current temperature is provided in Fahrenheit and Celsius, with the integer and decimal parts printed separately to ease use with snprintf.
+ [`getheadlines.py`](http://web.stanford.edu/~evandeo/cgi-bin/getheadlines.py): Displays the top 10 headlines from this [Google News rss feed](https://news.google.com/_/rss/search?q=reuters+news+-schedule&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en). Each headline is terminated with a '^' to ease processing by the pi.
